# CS-230-Final-Project

The client was the gaming room. They had a game on Android platform called “Draw it or Lose it”. 
They wanted to expand the software to other platforms through web browsers.

I kept this documentation short and concise. 

The UML Diagram in particular helped me a lot in writing out the code.

I would like to revise and put more specific recommendations for the distributed systems and networks. 
I feel like I did not elaborate the specifics in that part.

The game would be designed based on the platform it is being accessed with. I categorized the users’ needs through the platform they are accessing the game. 
This will make the work of integration of multiple platforms easier. The user is the most vital part of the whole project. Without users, the game would be obsolete.

Approaching it from top-down (general to specific) helps in understanding the crucial parts of the project. 
In designing software, we have to see the big picture first before moving to the details.
